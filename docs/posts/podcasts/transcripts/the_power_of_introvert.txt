I see introversion and extroversion in general  as just two different kinds of strengths. The problem in our culture is just that we emphasize  one type of strength, the extroverted strength, usually more than we do the introverted  strength, but that they're equally valuable.
It's probably not this binary thing, you're  introvert, extrovert. It's the spectrum of introvertedness, extrovertedness.  Do people move along the spectrum often? I feel like I've definitely  become more extroverted over time.
I've had the exact same trajectory you  just described. I used to be terrified of public speaking, now I do it all  the time. I used to be quite shy,
but that's not really describing, I don't  believe, becoming more extroverted, that's more describing acquiring skills. As we grow and  gain experience, we acquire all kinds of skills.
What people most want is just like, how do  I become potentially more extroverted/less allow introvertedness to hurt me in my career?
This is a paradox that I have observed that  the more introverts become deeply comfortable in their own skin, that's when they start to  show up at the job interview or on the stage
in a more powerful way, because you're  now there as your own true being, as opposed to there always being a voice in your  head saying, I'm not really supposed to be me.
How can you help people believe this is  actually true, that you can be just as successful being very true to yourself  versus learning to be an extrovert?
One of the most important things you can do.
Today my guest is Susan Cain. Susan is the author  of the number one New York Times bestseller, Quiet, The Power of Introverts in a World That  Can't Stop Talking. Her books have been translated
into 40 languages. Her TED Talks have been viewed  over 50 million times, and she basically made me and every other introvert in the world feel okay  about being an introvert, and showed that actually embracing that about yourself can unlock a  ton of opportunity and success in your life.
In her conversation, Susan shares a ton of very  tangible advice for how to be more successful in business as an introvert, including what skills  you should actually be building that don't come
naturally to you. Also, what actually is  an introvert? How to raise kids who might be introverted, and so much more. This was  such a wonderful conversation, and so much
of it resonated with me. This episode is for  anyone who considers themselves an introvert, or if you work with people who are introverts  and you want to learn how to help them thrive.

and I'm very excited to have Christina Cacioppo, CEO, and co-founder Vanta, joining  me for this very short conversation.
Great to be here. Big fan of  the podcast in the newsletter.
Vanta is a long time sponsor of the show, but for some of our newer listeners,  what does Vanta do, and who is it for?
Sure. So we started Vanta in 2018, focused  on founders helping them start to build out their security programs and get credit  for all of that hard security work with
compliance certifications like SOC  2, or ISO 2701. Today, we currently help over 9,000 companies, including some  startup household names like Atlassian,
Ramp, and LangChain start and scale their  security programs and ultimately build trust by automating compliance, centralizing  GRC, and accelerating security reviews.
That is awesome. I know from experience  that these things take a lot of time, and a lot of resources, and nobody  wants to spend time doing this.
That is very much our experience,  but before the company, and some extent during it. But the  idea is with automation, with AI,
with software, we are helping customers  build trust with prospects and customers in an efficient way. And our joke, we started  this compliance company so you don't have to.
We appreciate you for doing that, and you  have a special discount for listeners, they can get a thousand dollars off  Vanta at vanta.com/lenny. That's V-A-N-T-A.com/lenny for $1,000 off  Vanta. Thanks for that, Christina.
Thank you.
Susan, thank you so much for being  here. Welcome to the podcast.
Thank you so much, Lenny.  It's so exciting to be here.
I just want to start with just from one  introvert to another, and from someone that would rather be sitting in a corner writing  versus being on camera talking, performing a little bit. I appreciate you extra for doing  this, and flexing your extroverted energy.
Oh my gosh, absolutely. Thank you. And I know  you haven't even asked a single question yet, but in response to what you just said, because  you just identified yourself as an introvert,
that was actually a question I wanted to ask  you, because when I look at the work that you do in the world and the way that you do it,  and I had never seen you on video before,
I said to myself, "I'm sure Lenny's an  introvert." And the reason I thought that is because there's something about the  intensity with which you do your work,
and you're so passionate about your subject,  and your means of success is by going super deep into your passion, and that's such an  introvert thing. So I was like 95% sure.
That is so funny. I love that, I appreciate  that. Okay, so let me set a little foundation for folks. We kind of dove into stuff, but  I think this will be helpful. We're talking
about introvertedness. What is, what  are the clearest sign you an introvert?
Two questions you could ask yourself if you're not  really sure how you identify. So one of them is, how do you feel... Imagine that you are  going to a party, or networking event
that you are truly enjoying with company  you truly enjoy. If you're an extrovert, you probably find this incredibly energizing.  And so after two hours or so, you're looking
for more because you're now hyper energized.  And if you're an introvert, no matter how much you love all those people you were just talking  to, your battery is probably way drained. And so after two hours you're looking for the escape  route. So that's kind of one question to ask.
And then another one would be, if you imagine  a weekend, let's say, where you are totally free of social and professional obligations,  how would you choose to spend your time? And
how many people would be in the picture, and  how well would you know those people? Would you be allocating your social time to just  one or two close friends or family members,
or would you be excited about a party full  of people you don't know that well? Those kinds of questions tell you a lot about what  your true preferences are. And I stress that
phrase true preferences because for introverts  in an extroverted culture, we spend so much time kind of unconsciously adapting to what we think  our preferences are supposed to be, that I hear from many people that they kind of have lost touch  with how they actually prefer to spend their time.
First of all, I love the two-hour heuristic as  a, think I could just pay attention to after two hours. Because as you were describing  initially, no, that'd be really cool,
just like meet with a bunch of interesting people  for... If I'm an extrovert, if I enjoy that, I'll maybe am extrovert. But then it's like,  okay, at two hours. Okay. And so clearly to me be like, yes, I'll be exhausted  and want to go do something else.
Yeah, and don't you have the feeling of you wish you could just push a button and be  instantly home when you hit that wall?
Yeah, I would love that. What I find is I just run  out of steam, I just can't talk, and just like my
voice is like I'm pushing it out. That's really  interesting. Okay, so another thought I had as you were talking is, I know it's probably not this  binary thing, you're introvert, extrovert, it's
the spectrum of introvertedness, extrovertedness.  Is there anything along those lines that's useful for people to hear, just like how to think  about the spectrum of introvertedness?
Oh yeah, absolutely. So first of all, there  is a term that psychologists have termed that have coined for people who really are kind of  neither here nor there, they're in the middle
of the spectrum. So that term is ambivert.  And I think that does describe a fair amount of people. But then what's also important to know  is that even for people who are quite extroverted
or quite introverted like me, we still have our  moments when we're acting kind of out of type, because humans are incredibly complex beings. So I feel like it's really important when
talking about this topic, it's like two  opposite things are true. On the one hand, I really do believe that this question of  how introverted or extroverted we are shapes
so much about the way that we work, and  think, and make decisions, and love, and interact, and all the rest of it. It's  hugely important. Psychologists have called
it the north and south of human temperament,  so that's 0.1. But then on the opposite side, humans are gloriously complex, and there's  always a danger in talking about subject like
this of reducing ourselves and each other to  a label, and then expecting ourselves and each other to behave according to that label in all  circumstances. And that's, of course a mistake.
Do people move along the spectrum often?  And I ask this because I feel like I've definitely become more extroverted over  time. I used to be super shy and very,
very afraid of public speaking and big social  things, and I've just learned to not be as much, and I still definitely am. So is it common  for people to move along the spectrum,
and did they move in both directions, or  is it usually from introvert to extrovert?
Okay, so first of all, I've had the exact  same trajectory you just described. I used to be terrified of public speaking, now I do  it all the time. I used to be quite shy. I
would say I am still a shy person, but it's  not as much a top of mind, every day type of reality. Now that's not really describing,  I don't believe, becoming more extroverted,
that's more describing acquiring skills  and also managing fears. And even managing learning to manage a fear is a type of skill. So what happens is as we grow and gain experience,
we acquire all kinds of skills of the kind you  were just talking about. But I still come back to that question I asked at the beginning  of like, how would you spend your time when
you have no obligations? Because on that score,  most of us actually become more introverted with time. And I don't know if you would describe  yourself this way, but I remember for me,
even though I was a shy person in high school,  I would come home from school and spend my whole evening talking to all my friends on  the phone. And I would never do that now.
And psychologists have studied this, so people  tend to mellow out over time. So if you are, let's say the third most extroverted person in  your high school, and then you go to your high
school reunion 40 years later, you'll probably  still be one of the most extroverted people in your class, but all of you will have chilled  out and calmed down quite a bit. And that's a separate dimension from that dimension of learning  to be a public speaker and all that kind of stuff.
That is so interesting. I never thought  of it this way. I've always thought I'm getting more extroverted because I'm  doing more of this sort of thing,
and enjoying things like this more.  It's so interesting to reframe it into, I've just learned how to cope and be successful  in these situations, but I'm still the same.
And it's funny that you say that because I can't  tell you how often people have said to me, well, they'll either say, "Oh, you do public  speaking, so you never were an introvert.
You're actually an extrovert." Or they'll  say, "Oh, you've gotten more extroverted with time." And I would say neither of  those things is true. It's just a skill.
Okay, this is something I definitely wanted to  ask you about. So people hearing you right now, hearing you be very confident, clear,  just not coming across as an introvert,
also watching your Ted Talks, probably seeing some  of your other talks, it's not... You don't seem like an introvert. I'm curious just what your  experience of being an introvert is that might
give people a glimpse into, okay, I didn't  realize this about people. Because I think it's common to a lot of people. You see a lot of  people that are actually super introverted, but
they don't seem that way. So just to give people  an example of the stuff you've gone through, the stuff you deal with as an introvert that people  may not see. What are some examples of that?
Oh, yeah. And to your point, I can't even  tell you how many people there are out there presenting as quite extroverted. And then because  I have this funny role in society as the world's
confessor of introverts, they all come up to  me at conferences and things and tell me what they're really feeling, and who they really are,  and it's often the people you would never suspect.
But yeah, okay. I mean if you look at the way I  just spent my day before recording this with you, and it's now my time, 4:24 PM, so it's quite  late in the day. I have not really spoken to
many people today. I drove my son to and from  school, my husband's out of town, so I didn't talk to him yet. And then I've been working on  my laptop and walking my dog, and that's been
a really happy day for me. So in general, I'm  really, really happy lavishing a lot of social time on my family or close friends, but I don't  do that much social, technically social stuff.
And in terms of, I'm not sure if you used the  word overcome, but it was some kind of word like that in your question. So for things  like this, like super public-facing stuff,
that I really did have to learn how to get  comfortable with over time. And I used to be absolutely terrified of public speaking, like lose  five pounds before every speech kind of terrified.
And I want to say this, for anybody out there  who's listening who has this fear, because it's a lot, a lot of people that the miraculous thing is  that this kind of fear, as with any type of fear,
is actually overcomeable because there's this  miracle kind of phenomenon that psychologists call desensitization. That basically if you have  any kind of fear, you can expose yourself in very small and manageable doses to the thing that  you fear, and that's the way to neutralize it.
So I signed up... Before my book Quiet came out,  and I knew I was going to have to really be out there in the spotlight, I signed up for classes  for people with public speaking anxiety. And in
these classes you just had to, you'd start out by  standing up and saying your name and then sitting down again, and that would be the whole exercise  for the class. And then you'd come back a week
later and do a little bit more, and that's the  way to get over it. So I always encourage people sign up for Toastmasters or something like that  where you can practice speaking in supportive
environments where the stakes are really low  until you can retrain your brain that the stage is not actually a saber-toothed tiger, which  is what your brain currently believes it to be.
Okay, so let me come back to this, because I  think this what people most want is just like, how do I become potentially more  extroverted/less allow introvertedness
to hurt me in my career? But let me just  ask you this question, this kind of like- Can I actually stop you right there?
Yes.
I would just say I totally get it that  that's what people feel that they want.
But what we think we want is not always  actually the way to the ultimate goal we want. Because I think what we really want  is to learn to be completely comfortable
as ourselves. And I will... I know that  sounds like a bland or woo woo thing to say, but this is a paradox that I have observed  through all the years that I've been doing this,
that the more introverts or anybody else  become deeply comfortable in their own skin, that's when they start to show up at  the job interview, or on the stage,
or whatever the venue is in a more powerful way,  because you're now there as your own true being, as opposed to there always being a voice in your  head saying, "I'm not really supposed to be me, so I'm going to pretend to be somebody else." And  people can pick that up, and you can pick it up.
I think people hear this idea that you teach in  your book that you can be very successful as an introvert, and I bet it's intellectually  difficult to actually believe you can be
as successful as an introvert versus being an  extrovert. Because you see all these founders, they're very charismatic, extroverted, you see  people at meetings, all the loud voices in the
room always seem to get what they want. How can  you help people believe this is actually true, that you can be just as successful being very true  to yourself versus learning to be an extrovert?
One of the most important things you can do for  whoever's listening in whatever field that you happen to be operating in, is to look for people  in your field who have your way of being who are
introverted, and who are powerful. And there  are so many of them in every field. So just to go back to the public speaking example for a  second, but then I'm going to go out from there.
When I was getting started as a public speaker,  for me, my talisman person was Malcolm Gladwell.
Because he's an incredibly captivating  speaker, he's a self-described introvert, and the power of his speaking is not  being the super energized showman,
but rather he's a pretty cerebral person with a  lot of interesting stuff to say. And I thought, okay, not that my personality is exactly like his,  but it's like, okay, that's kind of a way that I could be on stage. I can have interesting things  to say that I'm very impassioned about saying.
And this is true, you can look at so many  different fields. So for example, in finance, somebody like Warren Buffet, he's a shy introvert,  he has talked about this. And a lot of the engine
of his success is that he figured out how to draw  on his own introverted strengths. So for example, he's known for spending hours pouring over  financial documents, and he's known for saying
that what gets people to be a really good investor  is not so much IQ, as having the temperament to control yourself and take prudent bets, which is  something that introverts are known for. There's
all kinds of studies documenting this and showing  introverted traders being especially successful, and so on. He's also known for selecting managers  very wisely and carefully, and then really
delegating and relying on those people, which  again is a hallmark of introverted leadership that we see in various studies and examples. Now, Warren Buffet was also somebody who started
out as a shy public speaker, and he signed  up for one of those Dale Carnegie training classes when he was like 21. And so he  learned how to be this kind of folksy
guy out in public. And so there's nothing,  I'm saying that's against the idea of, yes, acquire the skills that you need to acquire to  be successful in your given field. And yes, that
might require stepping outside your comfort zone  to acquire those skills, but there's a difference between acquiring skills and trying to be someone  who you're not. Those are really different things.
So yes, acquire the skills, but then learn how  to be you. And whether you are a public speaker, or a salesperson, or a negotiator,  or a marketer, or whatever it is,
there's a way to do that in a kind of more  thoughtful, more deliberative, more analytical, more listening-oriented style that can be  incredibly powerful. The bottom line of everything I just said is look for your role models, because  they're going to show you that you can do it.
That's such a powerful point. Just instead  of kind of assuming what you see in the media of just here's all the successful people  and just assuming they're all extroverts,
actually find folks that are in your orbit that  are successful, that are also introverts to show you and give you evidence you can be really  successful, and not have to become someone else.
Oh yeah. And if you're talking about the  realm of founders and startup people, there's just so many of them, especially  in the world of Silicon Valley,
Who comes to mind, those examples?
Oh gosh. I mean, dating all the way back to Bill  Gates and that era, there have just been so many.
This point of becoming more of who you are  is connected to something that comes up a lot on this podcast of the power of leaning  into your strengths, and not trying to focus
on your weaknesses, of just becoming more of...  Leaning into the things you're good at and doing the things you want to accomplish through that. For example, in my experience, I'm just like...
I'm not an amazing speaker, I'm not an  amazing person to run meetings, but I'm really good at like after the meeting, here's  the doc of the meeting, here's the next step,
here's kind of like a-sync followups and  stuff like that. And I found the writing let me accomplish all the same things without feeling  like, oh, I need to become this amazing presenter.
Absolutely. And I would say in addition to that, I don't think that that means that you need  to be limited only to writing. Because I mean,
even just talking to you for 15 minutes  or so, I get a feeling of like, okay, I'm talking to somebody who's extremely authentic,  extremely intelligent, extremely knowledgeable, and those are all incredibly powerful traits  that modest introverts tend to discount.
That's a good pushback and good  reminder, but I hear you. Okay, good, good. I want to go back to the tactics  you started to share of how to be successful
in business as an introvert, because a lot of  times companies aren't set up for introverts to thrive. And so I'm curious what either  you have done, or what you've seen people do as introverts to set themselves up  for more success in a business career.
Gosh, there's a lot we could talk about. I'll  give you a few ideas. I mean, one is to find ways to make sure that other people know how much you  know, and how much you're contributing. Because
I can't tell you how often company leaders  will tell me that they lose valuable people because those people aren't good at  self-promotion, and then their contributions
are undervalued or they feel undervalued, so  they end up leaving. And that is not good for anybody. Okay, so what can you do to do this? If you are somebody who is comfortable writing,
the way you are, you could start a company  blog or some other way of disseminating your expertise through writing that will thereby  gain attention. Another thing that you can do,
if you're either comfortable already with  public speaking, or are planning to acquire that particular skill, there's something in our  culture where people who put themselves forward on
a stage gain disproportionate respect. So if you  can put yourself forward to do, it could be like two minutes, it could be five minutes. Maybe you  start a lecture series at your company where you
bring in speakers and you're the one who's always  introducing them. So you're just on stage for the two minutes that you're introducing them, but  you're the one who put the whole thing together.
That's the kind of thing that can bring you a lot  of prominence with disproportionate bang for the buck. And that kind of thing is also a great way  of just practicing these skills and getting more
comfortable with them. Okay, so that's one. A second one is to, I'm thinking of a woman named Kathy Fish who until not long ago, was the  head of R&D at Procter and Gamble. And Kathy's a
self-described introvert, and she talked about  how her superpower was, she was really good at connecting with people one-on-one, and building  deep connections in that way. So she wasn't the
person who would sweep charismatically into  the room and everyone would know who she was, but it was like one by one, by one by one she was  building up all these relationships that as she
got more senior in her company, everyone knew  who she was, they liked her, they trusted her, and that turned out to be incredibly powerful. Third idea, quiet people often are misunderstood
to be unambitious. So if you're an ambitious  person, you have to make sure that your colleagues know about that. So I would look for  a mentor, and ask if you could have 10 minutes
to ask their advice. And most people love to be  asked for advice, and are happy to give it. And let that person know what your goals and hopes and  ambitions actually are for one year, three years,
five years from now, and ask for their advice  on how you could get there. And they might come up with one little strategy that will make a  huge difference for you, or they might start being the one to go to bat for you now that they  know that you have the ambition to do X, Y, Z.
This is awesome. Okay, let me summarize some  of the stuff you've shared. And this is kind of a list of things you as an introvert can  do to be more successful in your career, and probably in your life. And I'll include all  the things you shared, because it's all useful.
So one is look for a role model that's  really successful that's an introvert, to show you you can do this. You don't have  to be this extroverted, charismatic CO person.
Two is show your value, make sure people  actually see the value you're providing, because a lot of introverts don't. Three is  actually lean into public speaking and work
on that skill. To your point, it's looked at very  highly if you can do that okay. And your advice is just like do little bits. You don't need to  give a 30-minute, all-hands presentation, just
a little bit of time on stage goes a long way. I'll give one recommendation. I had this person on the podcast and I found this public speaking  course the most useful of all the things I've
done. It's called Ultraspeaking, and it's very  much based in doing it versus intellectualizing how to speak better. And it's made up of these  very low-risk games that you play with other
people, and you just talk without much support  and it's low risk, but it's at the edge of scary, and keeps kind of leveling up a little bit. Okay. And then, okay, I'll keep with through list,
four is connect one-on-one with  people. So instead of just like, I need to be amazing in this meeting it's like,  make sure you connect with everyone one-on-one
in the company and they understand how awesome  you are, and you end up being more... Look more awesome when you're going one-on-one with people  as an introvert. And then five is kind of make
it... Is the advice here around ambition? It's  like introverts are ambitious, but they may not understand how to achieve this ambition. So it's  less like make it clear you're ambitious, more so
come up with a plan to achieve this ambition by  getting advice from someone. Is that the advice?
Yeah. And first of all, I'm amazed that you could do that. I don't know how  you pulled that off just now.
Quick notes.
And I would add to it to make sure to kind of lean  into your strengths. And I was just thinking about
your case of when I said that I look at your  newsletter and I was pretty sure you were an introvert, it wasn't because, oh, this is a person  who's writing for a living. That piece actually
hadn't really occurred to me. It was because  you're so obviously someone who goes really deeply and really thoroughly into a subject of  passion. And then it's almost like a little,
here's journey. You're going into the  forest of your passion, and then you're bringing the treasures for the rest of us to  enjoy. And this is something that introverts
do very naturally. We tend to have one  or two or three passions in our lives, and one or two or three people in our lives who  are very devoted to you, and we lavish everything in the direction of those passions and those  people. And that is an incredible superpower.
And so very often if you look at introverts who  have become great leaders in a broad variety of fields, they're not the kind of people who  when they were a kid everybody was like,
"That child is a natural leader." They're not  that person. They're usually people who have these incredibly deep passions. And if you have  those, you end up acquiring a lot of expertise,
and building a network of people who have those  same passions, and inspiring a lot of trust from people who care about the same stuff  that you do, and that's a real superpower.
The way you describe it makes me want to  just hire a company of introverts. They go, they spend all this time finding treasures  for you and bring them back quietly and very.
That's funny. But actually, I'm glad you said  that because what I really do think, and the research bears this out too, the best-performing  teams and companies really are a mix of both. We
so desperately need both types. And introverts  and extroverts tend to really enjoy each other's company because we compliment each other so  well. And it's very easy to admire strengths and traits that we don't have ourselves. So there's  a kind of mutual admiration that goes on as well.
Speaking of that, it reminds me of, I don't know  if this was in your book or a different book, there's some data that shows salespeople that are
more introverted are actually more  successful. Does that ring a bell?
I think that the most recent study I've seen shows  the most successful salespeople are ambiverts, because they're extroverted enough to close  the deal, they're introverted enough to do the
listening that good salesmanship usually requires.  But having said that, you could be successful any
which way. And in Quiet, my book, I profiled a guy  who was like, I don't remember the exact detail, but something like the leading salesperson of  the year of Cutco Knives, and he talked about
how he would just go and do these deep listening  sessions with his customers and really figure out what they needed, and they trusted him because he  was authentically, curiously listening to them. So yeah, which is to say there's, whatever strength  you have, you figure out how to maximize it.
That resonates with product work. A  lot of people, a lot of the part of the job of a product leader is to figure  out what to build, and a lot of that is
talking to users, research and things  like that, and actually listening. And so it's interesting how similar that sales  anecdote is to being a great product person.
Something that this brings up for me is  the importance of saying no to things as an introvert that are not things that bring you  energy, and will distract you from this sort of
thing. And I know Tim Ferriss is writing this  new book called The Notebook. I was listening to your interview with him, that's why I had his  in my mind. But I guess, is there anything you've
learned about just, or any tactics you've  learned about saying no to things that one will de-energize you and two, just allow you to  go deep on stuff that you want to go deep on?
Well, I mean you might've heard the following  advice before, when I first heard it, it came as a revelation to me. But it's, when someone  asks you to do something that is three or four
or five months away, there's a tendency to say  yes to that because it feels so safely in the distance. So before you say yes, you should  ask yourself how you'd feel if you had to do that thing tomorrow or next week. And that's  the real test. But also and more broad level.
Okay, I love the psychologist  Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, late psychologist. He did all these  studies on creativity and wrote a book
about it. And at the beginning of this book  he talks about how he approached all these deeply famously creative people who he wanted to  study. And he said that he got back answers from
some of them saying, your study sounds  interesting, but if I said yes to these kinds of things, I wouldn't, I wouldn't be  able to do the creative work that I did.
Love that.
Yeah. And that leapt out at me, and I think about it all the time now when  I regretfully say no to this and that.
That reminds me of something that I often think  about. Naval has this, basically the same advice.
He has this insight that you start doing something  really well, you become successful with it, you start getting invited to parties, and events,  and talks, and collabs. You start doing that,
you have no longer have the time to do that  thing that made you successful well, and it all falls apart. And the trick is don't fall for  that, and keep doing the work that you're doing.
I know. It's really tricky, it's  very tricky because the thing is, when you do go to those kinds of events, you  actually usually do meet incredible people
who you're really happy to know. I mean, in  my experience, and some of the people I've met at those kinds of events over the years  have become my best friends. So I just try
to think of it really strategically. I just  pick a few of those things that I say yes to, and then I say no to all the others. But  I don't like to say no to all of them, because I do feel like there's something  meaningful that happens at every single one.
I'm more extreme than you. I actually created  a policy with myself. No events, no talks, no other podcasts. Just like, the default  is no, and once in a while I break the rule,
but that's what I find is what I need.  Because otherwise I'm just like, "Oh, that'll be fun. Let's go to this dinner thing."
Wait, wait, wait. This is fascinating. So okay,  you saying how often do you break the no rule?
Pretty rarely. If it's like a work thing, if  it's like friends, like meeting with baby, or friend, or something like that. But yeah,  it's pretty rare. I try really hard. Probably
because I get invited to a bunch of random  VC stuff, and talk and podcast things, so- Yeah, yeah.
... I'd say maybe 5% of the time I break it.
Interesting. Okay. Yeah, no, I understand.  And I actually do, I still do... I used to do a ton of speaking for companies and schools  and so on, and I still do do some of that, but I have consciously limited that so  that I can focus on other projects instead.
I find having a policy where  I could just tell people, "I have this policy that I just invented in  myself," is a really good way of saying no.
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah. Yeah, I've gotten past the  point of feeling guilty about the no, most of the time. Most of the time. Because yeah, life really is just too busy. And especially if  you're a parent the way you are, there's that too.
Yeah, I have this post where I shared all  my tricks for saying no that will link to, that has a bunch of templates you can use, and I  am excited to see this booked in first writing, because I imagine he has to say no a lot.
Yeah, yeah, absolutely.
One other thought along these lines is also a  Naval lesson, and it's interesting how much these insights stick in my head and make it, like change  the way I operate. His other piece of advice is
around networking, because what you're talking  about a little bit is like there's actually power in meeting people and networking, essentially.  And his advice is instead of networking,
do things that are valuable, and people  will come to you and want to meet you, versus you trying to meet them. And  I found this to be absolutely true.
I find it to be so true also. And also  even just for attending networking events, like if you've done something valuable, those  events are much easier because people want to
talk to you about whatever that thing is, and  you want to talk to them about their thing, and then all the other things that you didn't even
know about each other. But, I don't know. My other mode or MO for networking types of events is, I feel like if I meet one or two or  three people at one of those events who I truly,
truly like, truly want to stay in touch with,  truly want to be helpful to, I consider it a success. And then I feel like I can go home or  spend a lot of time in the hotel room after that.
Whereas I have friends, I see it, like  sometimes I'll go to one of these events and I have friends who make a point of meeting  every single person who's there. And then we'll
be talking a few months later and they'll mention  such and such person. They'll like, "Yeah, don't you remember? They were at that event." And I have  no idea who they're talking about. And so yes,
it would be probably a more maximum value approach  to meet every single person as long as you're there. But I don't believe that to be true if  you're not wired that way. And I think the power
of, over a lifetime, of just trying to have  from every situation in life, one or two people where the connections are true and deep, over a  lifetime you have a network that you really love.
All right, shoot. I got to  go to more events, I guess.
No, no, no. Oh my gosh. I hope  I'm not making it sound that way, because the truth is I go to so few.
Very few, yeah. This episode is brought to you  by the Fundrise Flagship Fund. Full disclosure, real estate investing is boring. Prediction  markets are exciting, meme coins are a thrill

I want to come back to tactics for introverts  to be more successful. One common I think challenge introverts have is in big meetings  with loud voices, having their ideas heard,
and even... Heard and then actually acted on. Is  there anything you've learned in those situations or tactics you've seen people implement that  make them more successful in these situations?
Yeah, so one very helpful tactic is to prepare  in advance for a meeting a couple of points you might want to make, or questions you might want to  raise. Don't assume you have to be spontaneous the
way other people appear to be. If you're more of  a preparer, you should prepare. And then also to give yourself a push to speak up early in the  meeting. Both because ideas that get advanced
early tend psychologically to be anchoring ideas  that people pay more attention to. But also for you, you'll start to feel more like you are part  of things, you're more at the center of things,
people will be directing their eye contact towards  you if you speak up early, and that becomes a kind
of virtuous cycle. So that's one thing. Another is to realize that yes, humans respond to the voice that's loudest  and deepest and all that stuff, but as humans
we also respond in an unconscious kind of  way to others who are speaking from a deep sense of conviction, like from a sense of  truly believing what they're saying. And
that is a muscle that you can strengthen. So I  would say even when you're not at the meeting, get into the habit of thinking, am I speaking  from here? Am I speaking from a deep place?
I'm not talking about voice right now. I mean like  mentally. When I say that I love this movie, do I
really believe I love this movie? And people will  know it if you're coming from that place, so that you don't actually have to be the loudest person  in the room in order for people to pay attention.
I just did a short meditation retreat and somebody there had this really interesting way  of doing exactly what you're describing,
where he visualizes this lightning cable  going form his... Instead of unplugging it from his brain and plugging into his heart  and listening to that, into what you're saying.
Yeah, it's just funny how that works. I think  one of the main hacks to understand about how we humans relate to each other is how  much we are picking up unconsciously,
a thousand different cues that we're  sending out without even knowing that we are. And that's why speaking from that  place makes such a difference. And so yes,
it can be helpful to think about your tone of  voice and all that kind of... And your gestures and all of that kind of stuff. But I would  start with what's actually there, the substance.
And again, this is a good example  of why introverts are so valuable, is I feel like it's probably easier to do that,  to be kind of talking from your heart and be
authentic. This tip you shared of speaking early,  I think is really interesting. It connects to, this is going to sound crazy and weird, maybe.  There's this whole pickup artist world of just, I
forget what the book was called, where they wrote  about mystery and this whole like, the art of picking up women. And one of the tricks that they  share with... Guy, and I did not do this, this is
just an interesting story, is if you're trying to  talk to someone in a bar, you should talk to them in the first five seconds of you seeing them and  thinking you should talk to them. Because once you keep thinking about it too much, you'll never do  it, it gets super scary, and it only gets scarier.
And I think that's true in meetings.  You just sit there and keep ruminating, "Oh my god, am I going to say something?" And  the more you do it early, the easier it all is.
Oh my gosh, it's so, so, so true. And  it's so funny to apply it to that setting, but it makes total sense. You reminded me of  how I first discovered this technique. It dates
all the way back to, I used to be a lawyer,  strangely, many years ago. And in law school, the way the classes were conducted, it was like  you'd be sitting in this gigantic amphitheater of people, and the professor would just call on you  cold, and you had to answer all the questions.
Oh my God.
Yeah, exactly. Oh my God. And so my strategy to  avoid that, which I did from the first day was I would be one of the first people to raise my hands  when they would ask for volunteers. And I figured,
okay, if I've volunteered and there's 150 other  people sitting here, they're going to call on those people, they're not going to call on me who  just volunteered. So that was my strategy. And not
only did it work in that way, but then I started  to realize, especially if you're one of the first people who's ever spoken, the professor kept  referring back to things I had said, not because
it was the smartest comment that had been made  all year long, but just because it was one of the first ones. And so it sticks in the mind. So it's  just one of those phenomena of human relations.
And you also probably just, like  you're participating more and you end up being more successful in  the class, and get better grades.
Yes. Yeah, so virtuous cycle again.
Man, I love it. Okay. What about from the  perspective of a manager or a founder that has introverts working in the company,  what advice can you share to make the
most of these folks that you probably might  be not noticing, or not paying attention to?
First of all, I would think about how you're  running your meetings. So there's a statistic from the Kellogg School that in your typical meeting  you have three people doing 70% of the talking.
But it's your company, and you want to make  sure that you're actually hearing from everyone, because you want to hear the best ideas. So  I would do things like techniques like go
around the room and make sure you're hearing from  everybody. Or if you have a specific person who you know to be thoughtful and reticent, you might  say to that person before the meeting, "Hey Bob,
I know that you have a lot of great thoughts  about such and such topic. Can I look to you to talk about that during the meeting?" And now Bob  is much more likely to step up and talk about it.
But also, for many introverts, we like to  be able to process our thoughts before we articulate them. So you've now given Bob advanced  notice, and he has more time to do the processing
before speaking. Another technique you could  use is a kind of brain writing where you, let's say everybody has to offer their thoughts  on how to solve a problem. Have people write
their ideas out on post-its, and then you  collect all the post-its and then you present them. And now all the ideas are out there  without anyone having had to jockey for time
or space. It's just the ideas on their own. Your introverts are going to appreciate the following thing more, but it will benefit  everybody. To make sure that you're giving everybody space to put their head down and work  in a state of flow without being interrupted.
That's huge for human productivity, but  the introverts need it especially. So if you can create times of the day, depending on your  workflow where there are no meetings or whatever, or people can work from home on such and  such a day or time, that can go a long way.
Oh man, that super resonates. What I did when  I had a regular job is I, well first of all, we had no meeting Wednesdays, which was  like the day everyone got all the work done.
Yeah.
And then the other thing that I worked... And I  have this post I'll link to productivity tricks, and one of them is around deep work. And I created  this block on Wednesdays and Friday mornings for
two hours that it was just work, deep work time.  And I labeled it, "Do not book time over this, or I will slap you." And it worked, and  I did not get in trouble. Be careful.
Yeah, and I'm sure people  appreciated the humor of it too.
Yeah. Yeah, they did That's genius.
HR never said anything. Okay. So just to reflect  back, the tips you shared, which are awesome is one is, just like actually ask everyone in the  meeting just like, "Hey, do you have anything you want to add?" Make sure everyone has a  chance, at least if they don't want to volunteer.
Two is give people, if someone you think is going  to have good ideas, just tell them ahead of time.
"Hey, I just want to make sure you share this  idea, or you have a chance to say something, please say something in the meeting." Three is  give people a chance to write ahead of time or
in the meeting, just create space for people just  to write their ideas down, not have to jockey for raising their hand and sharing something, and  then everyone hands in there their work. And then four is create deep work time, you give  people a chance to get into flow. Awesome.
Okay. I want to go in a totally different  direction. I don't know if it was your second book or third book. It was for kids,  kids that are introverts. I am, I have a kid,
he's one and a half-ish. It's pretty clear to me  he's an introvert. We went to a birthday party, he just went into the other  room and played with the toys.
Yeah.
He often just wants to observe for a while,  and then he starts to feel comfortable.
Yep.
Do you have any advice for  raising an introverted kid?
Yeah, I mean we could talk about this  for the whole entire time, very easily.
Okay, this will be the next podcast.  Yeah. But what are some thoughts?
Yeah, but I'll just give  you a few top-line thoughts.
Awesome. Perfect.
The first thing I always say is  to understand that introverted and/or shy children, have we taken a second to  distinguish between introversion and shyness?
No, let's do that.
I don't know if we have.
No.
Okay, this applies to adults as well as kids. But  introversion is more about just a preference to be in less overstimulating environments, more  mellow environments, less sound, less noise,
fewer people, just fewer stimuli coming at you.  And shyness is more about the fear of social judgment. So it's a kind of over-exaggerated  response to any situation where you're being judged. Could be new people at a party, could  be the public speaking, could be an interview.
And you might have situation A that doesn't  bother you, and evaluative situation B that really does, because people are complicated. So anyway, for children, whether they're shy,
i.e. fearful of judgment, or whether  they're introverted, i.e. I prefer to play in a mellower way. The key for both of  those kids is to understand that they will
tend to have a longer runway that they travel  down before they take off and fly. And this applies to a gazillion parenting situations.  So when it comes time to introduce your child
to school, it is very likely from what you've  just described to me, you said it's a boy, right?
A boy, yeah.
Yeah. Okay. So it's very likely that he is  going to be a little bit slow to warm up at the beginning. And it might be that all the other  kids get dropped off at the door of the school,
but your child might really want you to walk him  all the way down the stairs to his classroom. And that's okay. It's not okay for it to stay that  way forever, but remember when we were talking about desensitization with public speaking?  Where you do things step by step by step.
So you might walk him to the classroom a few times  and then say, "Okay, we're going to do a game, and tomorrow I'm going to walk you almost all  the way, but the last two steps you're going
to do by yourself." And then you celebrate it  with whatever little treat. Then the next day, maybe it's not two steps, maybe it's five steps.  Little by little by little you are moving away,
and he's going down that runway, and  eventually he will get to the point where he doesn't even remember that  he needed you to walk him into school.
This is going to happen again and again. When he's  learning to swim, a lot of quieter children are uncomfortable with the water at the beginning.  And you might feel as a parent, like, what did
I do wrong? Because I see all these other kids  who are just jumping in the water and my kid's not doing that. So first of all, give yourself  a break, because this is natural. And second,
you apply the same technique. You maybe get to  the pool on a day when there aren't a lot of people around, so it's not overstimulating. Quiet. And maybe the goal for that day is you're asking
your child, do you think you can put your big  toe in the water? And he puts his big toe in, "Yay, yay, yay," we're celebrating. And then  you little by little go from there. And again,
eventually you will not be able to tell the  difference between that kid and the one who jumped in right away. Longer runway, it's okay.  Okay. So that was my first piece of advice.
My second is, self-confidence comes from mastery,  and not the other way around. So we tend to think,
we live in a culture that's really big on  self-confidence, so we see self-confidence as the key to everything else. But in fact, if you master  a skill, you become self-confident as a result of that mastery. And this is true for all children,  it's especially true for quieter children.
Introduce them to a lot of activities, and figure  out which are the ones they really truly love, and gravitate to, and excel in, and those  will pay off great dividends, not just in
their mastery, but in their self-confidence. The third thing I would say is when they're feeling shy or uncomfortable, just talk about  it openly in a light way. It's not a big deal.
Share your own experiences. Let's say a child's  afraid to go to a birthday party. You could say, "Oh yeah, I used to feel that way too. It's  really common. Here's what I would do when
I felt that way. And you know what? I still  feel that way sometimes." And you could say, "So what I like to do is, I like to get to the  party early before everybody else is there,
because then I feel more comfortable.  So why don't we get there early today?" I do actually love to do that.
Well, there you go. Yeah, and a lot of  kids do best when they're one of the first people to arrive, because then  they feel like it's not overwhelming,
and they own the space. But the key is that  you're showing them that you understand, and are cool with who they are, and it just  becomes no big deal. As opposed to many kids
quickly absorb from their society the idea  that there's something wrong with their shyness. So you're trying to undo that sense  of shame and stigma, and make it no big deal.
That is really helpful. I forgot to ask you this  question at the beginning, but I am really curious what percentage of people are introverts?  Whatever you label that along the spectrum.
I've seen different studies. Some say it's  30%, some say it's 50%. It's always higher than you think, but it's basically one out  of every two or three people, so it's a lot.
So it feels like one of the core  pieces of advice you're sharing is if you're an introvert, you don't  need to become an extrovert. It's, become more of who you are, and you  can be really successful in that.
Yeah. I'm just going to add to that,  while also making sure that you acquire the skills that you need. I'm not saying  never step outside your comfort zone,
or don't acquire those skills if they're crucial  to what you're doing, like public speaking, the way we were talking about. But bottom line,  the goal is to use those skills to be who you are.
And that was an awesome point. So it's not  just like, okay, I don't need to go out of my comfort zone ever, I'm going to be the amazing CEO  just being exactly how I am. Your advice is no,
you actually do need to build some  stuff and build some of these skills?
Though I do want to say, on the other hand,  if the job you have taken on or the career you've taken on is one that requires  you to wake up every morning feeling
dread because you're going to be so far out  of your comfort zone for so much of the day, and so much of the week, is it really  worth it, in that case? I mean,
you basically want a life where you're waking  up, looking forward to what you're doing. Yes, with obstacles along the way, but more or less  you should feel like you're in the right zone.
So the advice there is find work that connects  with your introvertedness as much as you can.
With your temperament, yeah.
With your temperament.
Same for extroverts. I've heard  from extroverts who will say, "I work in this company of very introverted  engineers, and everybody's super quiet and heads down, and I'm going crazy."  So that's not right for you either.
Yeah. And it's not like you can't, like what  this makes me think about is we did a test of all the PMs at Airbnb while I was there, like  a personality test. And it's interesting how it
was all over the map, and there wasn't like you  need to be this energetic, charisma person. You could be just a thoughtful, quieter person,  and those people were just as successful.
Absolutely.
A big part of your advice is figure out who  you are and become more of that. Connect to your introvertedness, and you can be very  successful there. Is there any advice,
just what to do to do that, to what should you be  looking at? Which parts of you should you be like,
okay, this is where I'm strong  and I should be leaning into, and this is how I can become the best, most  successful people in spite of my introvertedness?
I mean, I might start by just asking,  what do you like to do? How do you like to spend your time? What are you most  interested in? Again, that question of,
if you had no social or professional obligations,  how would you be spending your time? Basically, you just need a really honest conversation  with yourself of what you like to do.
I love that it comes back to your kind  of heuristics at the beginning of just, if you had a free weekend, how  would you spend that weekend?
Yeah.
And then would you do a pie chart of  the activities to give you, here's how I want to generally spend my time, like 20% social,  40% on my own. Is that one way to think about it?
You know, that's funny because you  were mentioning Tim Ferriss before, and I remember when I was talking to him  on his podcast, he kept asking me, "Okay,
do you have a system for this and a system for  that?" And it was like, "I'm not a systems person the way you are." And I think his systems are  super helpful, I just tend to have a different
approach, like a more just intuition-based  approach or something, just like what feels right, and what feels wrong. And if you ask yourself  that simple question, I think you know.
That's actually, that alone is a... It connects to  something I often try to do. Just asking yourself,
does this feel right or does this feel wrong?  Some advice I recently heard along these lines, another way to ask this question  is, what is my body saying?
Yes.
I was invited to do this talk and I was  just like, I guess it could be good for the newsletter if I do this thing. And I actually  used your piece of it, the trick you used of,
if this were tomorrow, would I be excited? I was  like, no, definitely not. And then she actually is like, here's another trick at you. Because  I told her that, that's how I decided not to
do it. She's like, yeah, just like, what  is my body saying? And I was like, no, definitely not. My body does not... Like, the idea  of it not happening made me feel really relieved.
Yeah, that tells you so much. And I guess what I  would add to that is also you need to distinguish between the goal and what it would take to get to  the goal. Okay, so I'm thinking of a young woman
who I talked to after she gave a successful  Ted Talk, and had a successful book, and she was trying to figure out what the next step  should be on the coattails of these successes.
And what she said in the course of our  conversation is, she knew that she could build a whole company around her ideas  that were now out in the world. But she
knew from experience that she had had working  at other companies that she wouldn't actually be happy having to wake up and run a team  every day. And so she knew whatever I do, it's not going to be based on team management,  that needs to not be part of the picture.
And I thought that was a really useful way  to look at it because it wasn't, I think she would've loved to actually have the company and  put products out into the world that the company
would've made, but she wouldn't have enjoyed her  life to get to that goal. And so that question of, do I want to wake up in the morning doing what  it takes to reach that goal, is a really big one.
There's two things that brings up for me. One is  I had the co-founder of HubSpot on the podcast, which is like a gabillion dollar business at  this point. And he had a conversation with his
co-founder early on and he told him, "I never  want to manage anybody." And even up to today, he has never managed any, there's  nobody under him at the company, and he's still the co-founder,  still operating on his own.
Wow, that's- So, it's possible.
... fascinating that he could pull that off.
Yeah, he's a fascinating guy. We're  going to link to that episode, it's so interesting. The other is, I made  a role for myself with this new life along those lines that you just shared, which is,  I never want to have full-time employees.
Yes, me too.
Okay.
Me too. I did the exact same  thing with my Substack. No, none.
Great.
Yeah. And I do have different  people who I work with.
Yeah, same.
And including my colleague Renee and I  have been working together for 10, 11, 12 years amazingly. But it's a very loose type of  working structure, and that's what works for us.
That's exactly how I operate. And the major  downside is people sometimes leave because they're not full-time and there's  like, oh, here's a cool full-time
role that they found. But I find people  want this. They prefer to be a part-time, flexible thing, not this is their  life and this is all they're doing.
I think a lot of people like that too.
It's such a... But there's always this temptation.  Okay, but what if one person and they just deal so much for me, I think it also limits just how  much work you take on, which is really healthy.
It's so funny because when I started  my Substack, I talked to one of my now colleagues and I remember saying to him, if  in a few months I wake up and my day consists
of going to meetings, then I'm going to know  the whole thing... I went down the wrong path, and this was a mistake. So we have to build  it in a way where it's not about that at all.
Along those lines, I have a rule of no  meetings before 3:00 PM, to reduce the number of meetings I have except for podcast  episodes that we do sometimes in the mornings,
and that helps me there. Yeah, funny  enough, when I started the newsletter and it started doing well, I was like, okay,  this is awesome. What a life. Just write a
newsletter once a week and make a living, and  so I had this rule. I'll never do a podcast, I'll never do a course, I'll never do  a conference, I'll never do a book. And I've actually crumbled and done almost all  those things. The only thing left is a book.
That's really funny. So those  things that you ended up doing, have you enjoyed them, or were  your initial instincts correct?
The podcast, I am very happy I  did it. It's extremely cool to have the dynamic of the newsletter and  the podcast. Energy-wise it is, it takes
energy. I have to pull in the  extrovertedness side of me to- I get it.
Yeah. Versus like, I'm just going to sit in  the cafe and work on the newsletter. So yeah, it's mostly great, but I do have to get  up to do it, hide myself up into it.
I so, so understand.
And then the course, I decided not to do it.  It was too much of that. I stopped doing that.
The conference was awesome. Probably we'll do it  again. And the book, still have resisted the book.
Wouldn't the book be more along the lines of what  you like doing? Like you could sit in your cafe?
You would think, you would think. The problem is it just would be too much work. It's  just like the load of, as you know.
I do.
I think it took you seven years to  write your first book, is what I read.
Oh, yeah. Yeah. And then, well my second book  was the one for kids, that didn't take quite as long. But then my third book, Bittersweet  was the same thing. I took like seven years,
and I just sent in a book proposal to my agent two  days ago for another book, which will undoubtedly
take five, or six, or seven years. And I have  wondered how I'm going to do it together with the Substack, but I don't know. I feel very  impassioned about both, so I think it's fine.
Yeah, you have to really want it.  Part of the reason I don't want to do a book is all the talks I  have to do to promote it after.
Oh, I so understand. I think that's part of the  reason I take as long as I do to write them, because I'm like dreading the promotional  period, so I'm just putting it off.
Oh, man. Well I'm impressed you overcome that.
I mean, for me, my dream  always was to be a writer, so that was the primary, primary thing.  So I'll overcome anything for that dream.
I get that. Okay Susan, we've covered everything  I've wanted to cover. Is there anything else that you think might be helpful to leave  listeners with that, especially introverts,
that are trying to be successful, feel  better about their way of the world?
There is a phrase, an aphorism, a saying from  Gandhi who said, who is very shy and very introverted, by the way. Like, extremely. His  autobiography, very fascinating. He talks a lot
about this. He was such a shy kid, he would  run home from school after class because he didn't want to have to talk to anybody. He was  really like that his whole life. He was just,
he was one of these people I was talking  about who had a very deep conviction, and then attracted other people who shared  that deep conviction. And so he said, "In a gentle way, you can shake the world."  And I deeply believe this to be true.
That's an excellent role model to think  about in back, going back to your other exercise of Gandhi as an introvert. I did not  know that. That's awesome. Susan, with that,
we've reached a very exciting  lightning round. Are you ready?
I'm ready.
First question, what are two  or three books that you find yourself recommending most to other people?
So I was talking earlier about the psychologist, Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi. He famously wrote a  book about flow. It's literally called Flow.
And flow is the state of mind you get into  when you're totally engaged in an activity, and you're completely absorbed by it, and  you're feeling neither bored nor anxious,
you're just in it. And the book just describes  all the research on this date and what it is, and it completely changed my life, so I recommend  that one all the time. And also The Power of
Myth by Joseph Campbell, who was just a great  mythologist, and completely fascinating, and- Hero's journey.
Hero's journey, yeah, and he talked about the need to participate joyfully in the sorrows  of the world, which I really believe in.
Which I know your third book was about.
Yeah, that's right. Bittersweet.
Bittersweet. Find that on Amazon or your local  retailers. The flow book, can you say his last name again? Because I think nobody actually  knows how to pronounce it, and I love that you- No one does.
... can say it so comfortably.
Yeah, because my agent taught me how.  It's, you go cheek, like your cheek.
Oh my God, that's great.
Sent, me, high. So that's more  or less how you pronounce it.
Csikszentmihalyi. Oh my God.
Yeah.
What a win for a tip right there. Okay, next question. Do you have a favorite recent  movie or TV show that you've really enjoyed?
I never have anything recent, but so my  husband and kids and I just watched The Sopranos recently. I had never seen it  before, and we loved it. And I also just recently saw The Talented Mr. Ripley, which  I know it's really old, but so, so good.
Wow, I love how old these are.
I know, I know. But basically  anything that you see where there's just something dazzling  happening in it. Like Jude Law's performance in The Talented Mr. Ripley  is pure enddazzlement, if that's a word.
This connects to advice I often hear, which  is don't read books that are... Either read books that are just very new, or 10 years or  older. I think that's the advice. Don't read
books that are sort of... Because you want  to only read things that have have survived and people continue to come back to. Quiet,  I think is definitely an example of that.
Thank you. Yeah, I do think there's  something about that, like that... Yeah, if it's survived that long, it's for a reason.
Yes. [inaudible 01:12:02]. Oh, yes.
Okay. Can I say something that  will not be lightning roundish?
Please. Sure.
Okay. Because what you just made me think of is,  there's this, I guess it's an organization or institute, it's called the Tugboat Institute,  I think is the official name. And anyway,
it's basically it's four founders of companies  who are not interested in starting their company and then making a quick exit three years  later. These are people who are trying
to build something evergreen, and something  built to last. And so this is an organization for the founders who have this mentality. And  I've talked to the head of this organization,
I'm actually going to be speaking there in  June or July, and he told me that they have tons of introverts in this group of CEOs. I do  think there's something about that mentality of seeking the timeless and the evergreen that  is one of those underappreciated strengths.
That's awesome. That sounds  like a sweet place to be.
Yeah.
Hopefully not too many extroverts get in there  and they're just like, "What the hell is going on here? I don't want to be here." Okay. I'm  going to keep going with lightning round.
Yeah.
Let's see. Okay. Is there a favorite product you  recently discovered that you really love? Whether it could be an app, could be something you bought,  physical, something laying around the house.
I will say the art of roasted vegetables.
Cool.
Yeah, I've started just roasting  my vegetables with tons of spices of all kinds, and it's such a revelation.
And it's not a gadget, you just roast  them in a cooking sheet sort of thing?
Yeah, I just toss them with olive oil, and  maybe some lemon juice, and almond slices, or curry, or whatever I feel like  doing, and it's like candy. So good.
Interesting. And this is just like easy  way to eat healthy, and it tastes good.
Yep.
What a life chip. I just read this book, Good Energy. I don't know if  you've heard of this. It's about- No.
... what foods give you good energy  and what foods are bad energy.
Interesting.
And it's based on metabolic  health and blood sugar, and which ones spike you and help you,  and you're eating good energy food.
Yes.
Takeaway. Okay. Two more questions. Do you have a  favorite life motto that you often come back to, find really useful in work or in life,  maybe share with friends and family?
Yeah, I mean, I will give the one  that was the dedication to and the inspiration for Bittersweet. This is  a quote from Leonard Cohen who said,
"There's a crack in everything.  That's where the light gets in." I love that. I want to make a big poster out  of all these mottos someday of all these- Yeah. Yeah, you really should. You  probably have have amazing ones collected.
So many, oh man. Final question.  You have a very active Substack. I'm very impressed with how often you publish.  It's very hard. Where can people find it,
and just what should people know about  the Substack that you've started?
Oh, well, it's called thequietlife.net, so that's  where you can find it. And it's basically a place for people who want to live in the realm of  the quiet, and thoughtful, and sensitive,
and bittersweet. I've kind of been exploring  that realm for 20 years, and this is a place to be with other people who are in that realm also. And so some of the time I'm posting things about
tips along the lines of what we've been talking  about for this podcast. And sometimes it's more, I don't know, just sharing art and poetry and  things. So tomorrow I'm posting an exclusive
excerpt from Sahil Bloom's new book, The Five  Types of Wealth, about how much time do you have remaining with your loved ones, and how are you  spending that time? So I would say it's dedicated to how to live a good life from the perspective of  the quiet, and the thoughtful, and the sensitive.
Sounds like a wonderful place, corner  of the internet. How do people find it?
Just so we can LinkedIn, we'll  LinkedIn in the show notes too.
Yeah, so thequietlife.net, or I guess if you go  to Substack and just look up my name, you could probably find it there. But yeah, it's become a  huge labor of love because it's a way I'm able to write to people who have been reading my stuff for  years, but now we have a dialogue and a community.
And I think people really feel like having a place  to go that is a very specific wavelength that you can't find elsewhere can be something special, and  I know I feel that as the person writing into it.
Okay. Final question then is, how  can listeners be useful to you?
I usually ask how do people find  you online? We just talked about that. So I'm skipping that question.  How can listeners be useful to you?
I don't know. I guess I would say the Substack  that I'm doing is my baby and my labor of love, so if you want to partake of it,  I would love to have you there.
Awesome. Susan, thank you so much for being here.
Thank you so much for having  me. So nice to talk to you.
Solely my pleasure.
I really enjoyed it.
So nice. Just introvert connection.
Yes, exactly.
