00:00 I think that most people assume that their boss has to manage them and they feel a little bit resentful that you know why should I manage my boss like they're getting paid more. They are my manager they have more responsibility and you can continue to think that way and your career you know might be fine but if you embrace that if you manage your boss they're going to appreciate you much more you're going to get more opportunities you're going to have more trust with them. There's all these great things that happen when you decide to manage up. Wes. Cow is the co-founder of maven a cohort based learning platform that I use to create my own course on product management but even more interestingly. She's helped folks like seth. Godin start his alt mba course which is legendary. She's also helped people like david perrell thiago forte scott galloway and even morning brew build their cohort based courses. She's one of the smartest people I've ever met on the art of teaching and I've learned a ton from her and in our chat. We cover a concept. I love called the super specific who we talk about the state change method and how using this idea you'll run better meetings. We look at a bunch of advice for why you should spend time managing up and how to manage up effectively. We talk about a bunch of ways to write better tips for saying no and a bunch of other really interesting topics. I always have such a good time chatting with wes and I hope that you learn as much from this chat as I did and with that. I bring you wes count.This episode is brought to you by modern treasury.

It's my pleasure so just to set a little context about the west that we know today. Your career. Path has been pretty untraditional for many of the guests that we've had on this podcast and so I'd love to just hear a kind of a brief high level overview of your career and kind of understand. What made west the west that she is today. I started my career in corporate retail at the gap headquarters in san francisco. So I did a rotational training program rotating between old navy banana republic gap and it was a great foundation in business fundamentals. You know a lot of people talk about should I out of school go to a bigger company or should. I go to a startup. So I kind of went to a bigger company and gradually have gone to smaller companies since then until finally starting my own in the past 15 years. So you know I think that the getting to see inside what a company that's you know been around for 40 plus years was like was was really really fantastic training and uh set me up for success for for you know jumping into tech and another role. Since then. After gaap. I went to a beauty company that was acquired by shiseido and then was at an ad tech company that was acquired by snap and then moved cross-country from sf to new york to work with best-selling author seth godin and that just changed my trajectory completely.It was just such a transformative experience getting to learn and work directly with for three years. One of the best marketing minds and just most creative minds. I think on the planet uh right now and together we co-founded the alt-mba which I grew from just an idea between me and seth to thousands of students 45 countries. 500 cities grew our team from just us to to 60 plus people all over the world. So it's an amazing amazing experience and then after that. I consulted for a couple years working directly with other course creators who wanted to create their mini versions of the alt mba and from doing that really proved out the idea that the format of court-based courses was something that was really special that other experts in other industries other functions could really leverage and then that led to starting maven because when I was consulting and when I was doing all 10 va during those six seven years I realized how janky the tech stack was that everyone was using and I was shocked that no one had tackled this problem of all of us course creators needing to to uh toggle between half. A dozen different tools just to make a live plus async course be able to work and so when when my co-founder goggin bjani and I got together we were brainstorming you know what's the future of education and and catching up and we were just shocked that you know hey why hasn't anyone tackled this. Yet we should do this because we both really believe that core based courses are the future that more people are going to want to teach these courses. But it's just too hard from a technical perspective now but it doesn't have to be that way awesome.I definitely want to chat a bit about seth godin. I've been such a huge fan of his for I don't know a decade. I used to subscribe to his newsletter and I don't anymore because it's like an email every day and like it's overwhelming. Even though he made he pointed out in one of his newsletters like okay just ignore it. Why would you be sad that if so much content but it it yeah anyway unsubscribers but uh. But I'm such a fan and so I'm so curious one. How did you actually how did you connect with him and how did that even happen and then to what does he like to work with yeah. Both very very juicy questions so the way that we connected was seth put out a blog post saying that he was looking for a special projects lead to help him figure out what to do next. So. This was in 2014 when he had just sold off his last company squidoo that he had been working on for I think eight years or so before that. So he was kind of ready for something new at a crossroads wanted some fresh inspiration and I saw this blog post on a whim and at that time I was. I was at that ad tech company in san francisco and I thought there are probably thousands of people who are going to be applying to this so I don't want to get my hopes up. I did want to move to new york. I feel like everyone in sf you know in california at some time wants to move to new york and so. I thought all right.I'm gonna toss my hat in the ring and not overthink it and so the application required a video so there's written application and there's a video so seth said you know take three minutes to talk about what you want to build what you want to contribute and what you want to learn something along those lines and I did my video in one take. Normally. I would have done multiple takes for sure but here I just thought you know there's there's a very little chance. I'm gonna get this and a couple days later to my surprise. I get an email from seth godin. He's in my inbox and I'm just jumping up and down my living room you know because he's asked hey love your video. Let's hop on a call for an interview and of course. I you know write a very calm professional response and we did a couple rounds of interviews and I get the role so. I pack my life into six suitcases get an apartment sighting scene in this little town right outside of new york city where seth's office is called hastings on hudson and what initially started off as a six-month role eventually led to to over three years working together and starting the all-time b together.
09:26 So that's how we how we got connected very serendipitous. But my lesson there is don't take yourself out of the running before you get rejected like don't reject yourself. Basically you know um. I think a lot of us have have high standards and high expectations of ourselves. And it's almost like oh if I can't do the best application. Then. I just shouldn't apply you know if. I don't have time to take five takes of this video. I just it won't be good enough and so I just shouldn't do it so for me. That was a great lesson in putting your best foot forward but but putting your foot forward. I love that um yeah so that was that was how we how we got connected and then in terms of what it was like working with him. You know. I think I think the the set that people know externally can sometimes be different from the behind the scenes set. And I think that's true for all of us by the way um and so you know. I think externally he can sometimes be a little bit of a vague buddha. If you will you know he gives great inspiring advice his insights. I think are amazing like if you look at his blog.Some people try to copy seth's blog by writing short daily posts but that is not the reason. Why seth's vlog is so good right that that is incidental that they are shortened daily. They're the reason why it works is because they're so insight rich and in person. He is even smarter and even sharper than he is in writing and online which is so amazing. I'm just shocked by that because I feel like most people are the opposite you know. It's like you have time to curate what goes on your twitter your website. You have time to kind of um manicure. This you know what you want people think of you but when you're live you're just you're there with a person. You know like you're talking like normal people and you can really get a sense of how sharp or insightful or genuine someone is. And I think he's even more genuine even sharper even funnier in person. So that's what he you know that was kind of high level.I think the other thing is that internally we had really high standards for what we would ship which is a little bit different. I think than what you might think if you were if you were a seth reader you know because before I would read him and just do it essentially right like put yourself out. There don't overthink it and you might think that that means that there's a trade-off with quality. But the thing that I found so surprising about working together was that we often produced work almost always that was high quality fast and what's that third thing of that triangle cheap or like not cheap but like affordable or like economical right. Like usually it's like oh you only get two of these or or you know there's a trade-off between quality and speed. But we worked fast and we produced really great work and so I think for me. It really raised the bar on everything for me and on strategies on tactics on expectations on quality speed um. I think the speed that we shipped before. I you know was at a sukhoi backed attic start and I thought oh like I know what shipping fast is like. I was at a startup you know and and the speed that we shipped at at seth. Hu was just beyond like it just blew away. What I think normal people think of as as you know fast. But it was also still so good and so I think that rigor and that that refusal to accept anything but excellence was just so awesome and it just it really spoke to me because I care a lot about craft.I think more people should care about craft and I'm also kind of an obsessed person like. I have an obsessive personality and I just loved how seth was kind of similarly obsessed and so yeah learned so much from him that I've taken with me obviously in in you know building maven now and and everything that I do well. I have 10 more questions. I'd love to ask about seth coded. But I should probably try to get him on the podcast. What a what a coup that would be. I have a story actually. I just remembered while you're talking. I saw him mention once that he replies to every email he gets and so I emailed him because I was such a just.
13:31 A check had such a crush yeah just a chest and he replied and he's like why would. I say this if I wasn't doing this. What benefit would that be for me. He's like oh. It's so funny. He hates me. It's hilarious okay amazing one last quick question. You also work with scott galloway who's a very polarizing figure on twitter at least and you helped him create his courses. Maybe just one quick question on him. What's what's he like and why do people dislike him so much on twitter yeah. I don't know about people disliking him. He definitely has spiky points of view which I think are amazing um uh yeah so section four scott. Galloway's company was one of the first clients that I worked with after after leaving all's nba and I didn't work too closely with scott. I worked really closely with with his ceo greg shav and their exact team to design the sprint. That's now their their go-to course format but yeah. I didn't work too closely with him directly okay cool.We won't get too deep there okay so what I want to do with most of the time that we have together is to go into five big ideas you call five big ideas from west cow concepts that you've shared in other places. They've touched on your writing and tweeting and things like that that have struck and have stuck with me and I suspect many other people and just kind of go deeper on these ideas that sound good sounds great awesome so the first idea. I want to chat about is something you call the super specific how and he wrote a post about this and it really clarified a lot of my thinking on writing and the newsletter and the podcast and I find myself sharing this post and concept with other writers who are struggling a bit with their content and so can you just explain this idea of the super specific how and generally just how it can make folks better writers and thinkers yeah. The idea of the super specific how is that most writers most course instructors spend too much time on the what and the why and not enough time on how so if you think about people who are reading your writing. Most of them probably already agree with the general premise of what you're saying unless what you're saying is is truly controversial groundbreaking you're new to to your audience. You don't need to spend too much time elaborating on on the concept itself and why it matters people really want to know how do. I do this how do.I apply this to my own life. How do. I think about the nuances when I'm applying this what are examples that I can look at that help me better internalize how this really works. So a good example of this is if you're writing about product management and communication. Let's say so you don't want to spend too much time saying talking about how communication is important for product. Managers. Right like most product managers already know that like that's pretty one-on-one. It's pretty basic. Instead. You want to spend that time talking about how to get buy-in when you don't have positional authority as a product manager or how to turn chaos into order and be able to communicate effectively across multiple stakeholders or how to communicate ideas where they're kind of assertions and hypotheses that might not work but you need to put something forward to get the team going right. These are all elements of communication that are juicier and more specific than just saying you know here's here's why communication is important yeah.So a lot of it is cutting the back story basically right and just like get right to the meat of it. I found that exactly yeah ever since you wrote that I'm like this is why this is why a lot of my writing seems to work because I don't. I don't. I try to cut the intro as much as possible and just get right to the beat of it yeah. I find that sometimes in my writing. I'll write and then go back and cut a lot of the preamble so most people need less context setting in preamble than you might think and I have a framework that I call start right before you get eaten by the bear and the idea is that if you're telling a story about camping don't start talking about going to rei to buy a patagonia jacket and then booking the campsite and the website had difficulties and on the drive over we stopped by the gas station. No one cares about all all that right like start right before you know your friend left a cliff bar out in their tent and you all almost got mauled by a bear right like get to the juicy part and start you know a little bit of context right before we get to the juicy part but but that's the idea of start right before you get eaten by the beer is cut out all that backstory scope creep.I like that there's also this element to your thinking that you didn't touch on which is kind of this. I think you call it the content hierarchy of can you speak to that yeah yeah. So if you imagine a pyramid triangle at the bottom. There's more room for bs and at. The very top of the triangle there's less room for bs so what's at the bottom of that triangle. Twitter podcasts short you know articles right. It's basically situations that are one directional where people can't really challenge what you're saying keynote speeches. Another great one for you know lots lots of room for bs so those are situations that you know they're more one directional with twitter at least it's 280 characters. It's something short that you're saying that's a little bit of a mic drop. You just say it you leave it there and then you get to walk away without needing to defend it without needing to share your rationale or think about countering points. And so there's more room for bs right.The format kind of encourages or allows it let's say it allows it but as you move up the triangle uh the content hierarchy bs there's less and less room for bs so long form in-depth articles less room for bs right. You have to defend the idea you have to convince your reader books also less room for bs and at the top of the triangle courses one directional courses like video courses on udemy linkedin learning but especially cohort based courses where there is live and async interaction. There's very little room for bs so if you think about a webinar a keynote talk or a book. It's you know you kind of say the thing and and that's it but in a court-based course where your students are right there with you where they can ask questions when they can have conversation in the zoom chat box like if you're saying something that doesn't really make sense there could be a whole conversation happening in zoom. Chat saying like this doesn't make sense for xyz reasons right and so you have to be able to defend what is that you're saying and make sure that what you're saying is rigorous and I think that thinking about that content. Rvs is is great for holding ourselves to a higher standard to make sure that we are not allowing ourselves to spew bs just because a format might allow it. You know a book for example. Obviously the content of that book the contents matter more than just the format and so there are books that could be 10-page blog posts and there are books where every page earns its real estate. So there's still a little bit of you know nuance in the hierarchy but in general as you move up that hierarchy. There's less and less room for bs. I think this framework explains a bit why twitter's so cringed to a lot of people is these like threads that just sound so wise but yeah. There's not a lot of depth to them if you really think about it and it's easy to sound smart. So one thing I'll add is. People are listening and they may be like oh of course courses are at the top. Wes runs a course company but having run a course and created a course. I 100 agree that there's just no room for bs in a course because one there's just so much content. There's so much time that you have to like cover and so you can just like here's a wise thought. Let's move on you have to actually get into it and people hold you accountable to that kind of thing and then to your point. People are gonna ask questions you're like oh. I don't that's all. I got nothing more dad. That's not gonna cut it and so I totally agree that and that's why courses. I think are so powerful and probably a much better way to learn than just reading a blog post or listening to a podcast. If you really want to go deep on something so I love that concept anything else you want to add on that idea before we move on to the next concept. Let's go let's do it do it okay so when I was building my pm course with you you blew my mind a number of times on how to actually teach effectively and one of the lessons you taught.
21:58 Me was around the importance of creating state change in the talk how to create state change and so without giving it away. I'd love to just hear your thoughts on why what is state change. Why is it important and just how does it help you not only give better talks but also even better zoom meetings yeah. If you think about most zoom meetings or presentations. It's one person talking at you the entire time and everyone else has to listen silently. It's pretty hard to do that on zoom where your your camera's on you're sitting you have to sit still look straight ahead at the camera control your face and like make sure you look focused and so it's really it's really not surprising that most people find that very draining you know they want to turn off their cameras. They get distracted so the idea behind what I call the state change method is that you should punctuate your monologues with state changes. So state changes are anything that shakes your audience awake and adds some variety so it might be asking people to put something in the chat box.It might be switching from gallery view where you see everyone kind of that brady. Bunch grid and switch over to screen share to share something and then switch back. It might be having someone else speak. It might be asking people to unmute themselves and go ahead and chime. In it might be putting people into breakout rooms. So they can discuss amongst themselves and then come back and then do a popcorn where you know someone shares out and they popcorn to the next person to the next person. So all these are examples of state changes that help your audience stay engaged with the material that you're presenting and it's really it's really in reaction to monologues. You know like I'm kind of imagining salesforce. There no software sticker if you think about no monologues right like try to avoid monologues as much as possible because that put your audience to sleep what are examples of different states. You mentioned uh breakouts chat whether what other sorts of things can you do especially on a zoom. Let's say for running a meeting yeah so we talk about breakouts zoom. Chat switching from gallery view into screen share to show something and walk through it and then switch back there's polls asking people you know before before you reveal something you can ask what do you all think right go ahead and guess. So you know in the maven course accelerator. The two-week course that I teach on how to build a core based course.It's very meta you know. I will ask people so what do you think the average attention span is for students so I could I could have just told people like it's x right but any time when you want us when you want to just share a piece of information. That's an opportunity for a potential state change have people guess right the more they engage and think about the problem themselves the more that they are going to to remember and also just interact with your material. So I asked people to guess and then the answers range from an hour or 45 minutes to three seconds. So it's you know it's all over the place. The answer is two to four minutes according to to some research so you know that's that's a ripe opportunity for state change and the other way to think about it. I was talking to nathan barry from convertkit. He was saying that he loves state change method two and that anytime he does a presentation now every three to five slides. He'll put in a state change. So the idea of every three to five minutes every three to five slides go ahead and put in a say change we really want to turn this from an art into a science as much as possible um audience engagement and if you just kind of force yourself to look through your own material and say like oh like have I done a state change in the last couple of minutes if not go ahead and throw one in and more likely than not when you look at that material. At that you know at those intervals you'll find something that lends itself really well to a state change. I'm feeling pressure to create some state change in this podcast hey listeners when was the last time you were in a meeting where there was some meaningful state change think about that. For a moment love. It yes okay. We're pros you can't try to practice this lesson live. There's also this concept that you touch on called.I think it's called eyes light up concept or something like that okay. Cool can you speak to that because I think it relates to this idea of state change in meetings yeah. So the idea behind what I call eyes lighting up is that you know when you're talking to someone and you're explaining something you're teaching them you're sharing your startup idea or whatever the normal response is. People will want to be polite so they'll nod you know and they'll say like oh okay that's interesting. But there's usually a moment in the conversation where their eyes light up because they are genuinely actually interested in what you are saying at that moment so you as the presenter as the you know sales person whatever that's pitching you want to make note of the moments when people's eyes light up because their face can't lie right like they can say oh yeah okay that's interesting it's easy to kind of say that and be polite. But when someone's eyes light up that's a sign that something that you said triggered a reaction in them a visceral reaction and I think so many of us you know we like to to pretend that oh you know. I don't get enough data from people and you know this person said this but what do they really mean and and really. I think that we're just being delusional if we just acknowledge reality and like this person looks bored they look bored that is data okay like don't ignore that data right and then oh wait there. I said this this hot key word or this phrase right. I explained something this way and and all of a sudden their face change. Their demeanor changed they're leaning forward. They're wanting to catch what you're saying like that's all data. So so really the principle behind eyes. Light up is don't be delusional in just taking people's you know what they're saying at face. Value really look at their face look at the you know look for other clues. The the excitement in their voice and watch for these different eyesight up moments because those are great fodder for content that you might want to write about for the angle of your sales pitch for how you might want to explain something in the future and really cut out all the parts that that you know make people go dead in the eyes and just say the parts that make their eyes light up. Hey listeners. What kind of eyes letting up behaviors can you can you think of that show you somebody's really into your content yeah or when are times when you know in in recent weeks when you've explained something or given a sales page and and saw people's eyes light up.What were you saying in that moment think about that and jot that down and so the skill here is okay for sales that's interesting so as a salesperson that'll help you understand what part of your pitch resonates I imagine for presentation prep. This is a useful skill obviously for building courses probably less useful for meetings. But I imagine. There's also just like oh wow this person got really excited when I share this thing maybe spend a little more time yeah. I think it absolutely works for meetings. I think it works for internal meetings for conversations even with your cross-functional team members with your boss with your direct reports you know usually as you're explaining something you can tell when you even your manager is like oh yeah that right or like you can kind of tell like there's there's more energy in in the response for certain parts and when you think about it you can find patterns of oh you usually when I when I share things with this person you know they tend to react well when I share these things so why don't I trim out. The other contacts that they don't really care about and focus on whatever you know made their eyesight up and it might be talking about numbers or it might be talking about upside or it might be talking about how little effort this is to try or whatever angle it is.It really gives you great data that you can kind of lean into and flush out. More you mentioned your manager and that's a really good segue to our next topic which is around managing up if a feature ships. But no one knows about it did. It really ship keeping customers and internal teams like sales support and marketing in the loop on what's changing across your product is surprisingly hard. First you have to dig through tickets and pull requests just to see what's been done. Then you have to figure out what's relevant to each person craft updates and then share them across all of your channels multiply this by the number of things that ship every week and that's basically a full-time job just to keep everyone updated on what's changing. That's why high velocity product teams like monte carlo armory and popsicle use make log. Makelog makes it easy to see what's happening across tools like jira linear asana and github and then to write bite-sized updates which you can immediately share with your audience wherever they are including within your app on slack over email and even on twitter. No more long boring blog style change log posts that slow you down just quick and easy updates that keep your users informed and happy try make lock for free today. Just visit makelog.com lenny to get started. I think your most popular tweet you've ever tweeted is around the skill of managing up and funny enough. I had a threat on managing up years ago and it's also my most popular tweet thread ever so there's a lot of interest in this topic and so. I want to ask you.
30:58 Why is managing up important. Why are people not doing it well and how do you manage up effectively great questions. I think that most people assume that their boss has to manage them and they feel a little bit resentful that you know why should I manage my boss like they're getting paid more. They are my manager. They have more responsibility and you can continue to think that way and your career you know might be fine. But if you embrace that if you manage your boss they're going to appreciate you much more you're going to get more opportunities. You're going gonna have more trust with them. There's all these great things that happen when you decide to manage up and I think you know more people are realizing that you know hey as an individual contributor. Even as a manager we all kind of have bosses right so you know even as someone who leads people. You still need to manage up if there's no point in seniority where as you climb the career ladder that that it just doesn't matter anymore and I think some some people think that senior people don't need to manage all like oh one time once. I'm you know a director or vp. I don't need to manage up anymore. It's only something. I need to do and when I'm a coordinator or you know you know an associate pm or something. But ironically the most senior people are best at managing up. This is why they got promoted in the first place because they were great at managing up to their bosses to understand what was worries worrying their bosses.What was keeping them up at night so that they could take that off their plate. They were you know they're great at keeping their bosses in the loop on what's happening so their bosses aren't constantly having to ask and you know pepper them with questions every day on hey. How's this going or what's the status of this or do we take care of this thing right. They're proactive in communicating so their boss knows that certain things are taken care of and so there's so many benefits that you can reap when you choose to manage up. How do you suggest folks do it. I actually have a tip but uh is there something you you have you want to share in that yeah. I think one really big way of doing that is keeping your boss in the loop on the kinds of decisions that you're making and what you're working on. It feels kind of almost blase like well duh right but but actually. I think I think we all know that we should do that but the way that we execute you know.I think sometimes your boss doesn't feel like they're in the loop right and so proactively giving the right amount of context for your manager to be able to weigh in on on what you're doing and to be able to give feedback. I think that's that's you know super super important and then you know thinking about the right level of context to give them right does your boss is this a reversible decision or is this one that um that is irreversible or difficult to reverse or expensive to reverse right kind of using your sense of judgment so that you're not necessarily going to your boss for everything and telling them everything like that's overwhelming for your manager who has a lot going on. It's really using your sense of judgment and good common sense to think about okay. I want to you know recommend that we do this thing how do I share enough context about my thought process and rationale so that my boss has enough information to be able to push back if needed or to be able to approve and know that I've gotten it taken care of awesome so to build on that something.I did for a long time that was really powerful. It's really simple is I sent my manager. A state of lenny email every week just titled the state of lenny and it had basically three sections. My priorities currently blockers that I need their help with maybe that was the first thing that I put up just to make sure that they saw that and then just things on my mind currently that week and that I think is such a simple but such a powerful way to do exactly what you're talking about keep people in the loop. What you're doing make sure your line of priorities make sure things are getting unblocked and also just avoid surprise as much as possible and so there's a little tip.I love that I think the avoiding surprises is great. I think in a work context. Surprises are generally not great so. I always say you know unless you're surprised me by bringing me a snack or something like don't surprise me like actually in my personal life too. I just I don't like surprises so. I think especially in work not throwing something over to your manager that just catches them. Off guard is is good. I like that general rule avoid surprises except for birthday parties and and milestones yeah that also touches on just the general rule.
35:36 I have of working is just over communicate. I find nobody's ever like just letting shut up. I don't want to know about things like it's always the opposite why didn't. I know. About this even if they don't pay attention the fact that they have the chance to see it. It always goes a long way yeah. I find especially in remote work too erring on the side of over communicating is just. It ends up being the right level of communication like you think you're over communicating but to the recipient. It's actually just the right amount and you know I've been surprised by how I thought everyone was aligned on a certain strategy or that we've oh we've already talked about this thing three times and then realized that oh we actually weren't as aligned as I thought so erring on the side of over communication is great and I think also structuring your communication in a way where if someone already agrees with you or they get it they can get the gist but if someone doesn't get it they can continue reading so that kind of helps people spend their time well you know so I'll usually put the most important point at the top the tldr if you will the gist and then I'll say context colon and then that there might be multiple paragraphs of context below for anyone who wants additional thinking on how did I get to this decision or how did. I you know how did. I think about this. But if they already agree with the decision and kind of know that context and they don't need to keep reading.I actually taught that format in my course. I think it was rooted in the military where they're just like their emails start with bottom line. Here's what you need to know and then context bullet point bullet poi point and so it's a really simple way of just communicating things. Although one student used that format with a potential customer where it started off being bottom line here's where we're at and they're like man. That's that's aggressive and so. I had to adjust that yeah a little softer okay. So I was gonna. I had this beautiful segway but uh anyway you talked about communication and that's a good segue to talking about writing. And you have a lot of great advice on writing and how to write well. We touched on a bit of this of cutting out the backstory and being super specific with the how but do you have any other advice for just writing in general. Because a lot of folks that listen to this are trying to write more and you have some great stuff on this so yeah. What do you what can you share yeah. I think a lot of people learn writing from mimicking other people and kind of learning by analogy especially on twitter or on social which I think is useful to a certain point. But I also think that there's a lot of benefit in studying the craft of writing you know off of social so one of the books that that I've been recommending and I think.I'm jumping ahead to potentially a lightning round question but uh not allowed it's a book called it was the best of sentences. It was the worst of sentences by june casa grande. I think it's their name so we'll link this. The show notes and another one is better business writing by harvard business press. A whole series on you know leadership managing up writing etc. And I recommend those two books usually to to new team members who join because they cover more of the the craft of creating strong sentences paragraphs arguments and thinking about the logic of what you're saying a lot of times. When we write a sentence.There's actually already a point of view or um. There's there's a point of view baked in but you don't want it to be an accidental point of view right. I was just talking to this to my team member. About this. She asked me to give her some feedback on something that she wrote and the way that she had written her paragraph was leading for the reader you know it was. It was about an off site that we have coming up and she talked about whether we should change you know wework location something like that so this is actually like super useful tactical stuff for slack messages. You know if you're dming someone if you're if you're texting someone like you can use these principles basically everywhere and so she was you know it was a slack message about about changing work locations and the way that she had phrased it. The obvious conclusion was oh.We we should just stick with our current one you know and and so I asked her is that your recommendation because if it is then great because you're kind of leading the reader to that to that conclusion. But if it's not you're asking a leading question that is skewing the results of this question you know and so it turned out that she was she was kind of open like she didn't really have an opinion so we thought like okay. How do we adjust this so that it'll get a more objective response and then we talked about it some more and thought you know. It's actually better if you do share a recommendation here. It's easier for the reader. So how do we then adjust it. Some more so that the recommendation is intentional within within that paragraph. So it's a little bit. I know.It's not quite a sound bite. But I see this a lot in in people's writing is that there's there's these either sentence structures that add more cognitive load to the reader or have a little bit of confusion. And it's it's a technical issue actually. It's like the witch or some clause explains something directly before it. But they actually meant to you know meant for that clause to describe something. You know 10 words before at the beginning of the sentence right. It's kind of hard without a visual but anyway both of those books talk about the mechanics and the the technical aspects of writing the craft of writing really well and I guess. My spikey point of view is that more people should should learn the craft of writing and the technical aspects of writing. Not just you know look at what other people are doing to try to get audience engagement but to actually improve your ability to precisely say what you mean and convey the level of conviction that you have and not accidentally mislead people with your words because you didn't know that the way you wrote something could potentially mislead them got it.
41:30 I actually got that same feedback that you gave this person once when I i like clearly had an opinion on what we should do as a team and I i gave pros and cons and it was like very biased and clear what. I thought we should do and my manager's like don't do that just try to be as unbiased as you can or just tell me. Here's what you think we should do and here's why yeah. I love that and I think I think going you know pulling on the thread a little bit. It's because pros and cons lists. The the structure of a pro and con list implies that you are giving equal weight to pros and cons that you are accurately talking about pros and cons right or objectively talking about them. So when you do pros and cons list. But they're skewed and you're leaving some things out of the cons list. It makes the reader suspicious and they can't trust you anymore right whereas if you do a pros and cons list but at the top you say. My recommendation is x here's pros and cons of that or here are some risks associated with whatever you're building trust with your reader because you were direct and saying here's my recommendation. Here's what I'm advocating for and also here are some downsides to that right.This also reminds me of the minto pyramid which I won't get too deep into but the concept there is in business. You often want to start with here's my conclusion and then here's here's why versus here's all the things. I've done here's all my thinking. Here's all my all my kind of data points and then now here's my conclusion at the end of that in business people are like just. I'm bored just tell me what you think we should do and then and then help me understand why you got there. The worst which happens a lot is mixing all of those things with the action item or decision. So the action items and decisions are kind of interspersed randomly throughout a bunch of context thought process factors that you looked at downside. It's like. It's all just interwoven and so your reader doesn't know which parts are fyis or which parts are kind of background versus. What is the thing that you want their response on like what are you asking them to chime in on and what is the decision that that we are we're actually trying to make so if you do add you know all the thought process. I think splitting it up and making it clear that you're splitting it up makes it so much more helpful for your reader awesome and we'll link to all this stuff in the show notes so don't feel like you have to remember all this okay. So this is a a good time to get our fifth section and our fifth topic which is around the scale of saying no. I feel like this is such an under taught skill. I heard that tim ferriss was working on a book called the notebook where he was gonna share all the ways he's learned to say no. But I think he shelved it for whatever reason and i.I need advice on this because I'm often asked for favors of all kinds and I am not amazing at saying no without being uh. I try to be really nice about it and it takes time and so I could use advice here so. I'm curious to hear your advice on saying no yeah saying no does not come naturally for me either as kind of a recovering people pleaser. So. I thought a lot about how to say no in ways that feel warm and respectful and you know respect the other person. So I think there's there's a there's different ways to say you know depending on the situation and your relationship with that person so within work. For example you know saying no to to your cross-functional team member or to your manager right like that's very different than saying no to someone who doesn't know you on the internet who is damning you asking you to help them with something and so you know with saying no with people that you have. Let's say long-term dynamics with continuing dynamics like a manager a friend etc. I usually like talking about the trade-offs of something. So. This is something that I learned from alex peck my co-worker at alton va who's now ceo of autumn ba. He was always great at this so when we worked together he was my design counterpart and I would ask him like hey can you you know can you design. This. For me can you design that and oh you know here's another thing. I'm going to throw over the wall to you and he was always so good at saying no in a way that like felt good for me the person who just asked me to do something and I just thought like that's pretty different because usually when people say no. I'm a little irked or you know a little miffed so. I thought like what is alex doing that that I can borrow from and it turns out that alex would always talk about trade-offs and he'd say you know wes yes.I can design this pdf for you that means that the thing that I was going to work on today which was redesigning you know this page on the site. We'll have to wait until later this week or this means that you know I'm going to be de-prioritizing. This other thing does that sound good to you or like do you want me to you know prioritize the original design project. You wanted me to work on you know and so for me hearing that it it felt like. I was in control and able to to help help and prioritize basically so it kind of. It went from being a conversation about yes or no are you a helpful person or are you not are you. A team player are you not into hey like how do we make sure that the important right things get done you know and so it was. It's great for the person who you're saying no to and it's also great for alex because whenever he we had those conversations. I always thought that he was really thoughtful about making sure that the most important projects that we want to work on stayed prioritized. So it's kind of.It's a little bit of a workaround. So you're not exactly saying no but you're talking about trade-offs which gets the the result of the no right. You're getting the the the reason why you want to say no is. We don't have bandwidth to take everything on um. But we feel weird about saying no to people because we're afraid that people are gonna. You know think we're not we're not cooperative or whatever so so by talking about tradeoffs. You really get the outcome which is you protect your bandwidth. You protect your bandwidth. You protect your mental health. You protect your you know ability to do great work without feeling overly stretched without actually even having to say the word no which I just think is amazing. This is a concept or a related concept that a manager once taught me which is essentially the same idea and she called it prioritize and communicate and the idea here is. Someone gives you something to do. That's it's not already in your plate. There's kind of there's kind of a two by two you can imagine your head. There's you can just prioritize it amongst your priorities and not communicate what you did and where it sits or you could just communicate and not prioritize and that just means like sorry.I don't have time for this right. Now what you should do is prioritize it. Here. It's gonna sit in number three my priority list and communicate. This is going to be third in my priority. List does this seem reasonable to you would you agree should. I do this sooner or not and that's a really good way of dealing with exactly what you're talking about and so it's a little framework.
48:19 I love that I love a good two by two matrix and that is a fantastic one. There we go sweet anything else you want to touch on that topic before we move to our very exciting lightning round. Let's do the lightning round okay. Here we go I need some sound effects. I think yeah but anyway until then okay. So I'm going to ask you five questions and just tell me whatever comes to mind and we'll go through it. Pretty quick sound good yes okay.You already knew this was coming what's the book that you recommend most you've recommended most in the past few months. The two craft of writing books that I had mentioned can you just remind us real quick while we're on. There yes it was the best of sentences. It was the worst of sentences casa grande yeah so good and then better business writing by harvard business review or harvard business press awesome. I gotta read these okay number two what's a movie or show that you've recently watched and loved that maybe people haven't heard of there's a show called dr foster on netflix. That's I think it's on netflix might be on prime. It's a british kind of drama crime thriller. That's super good. I love kind of mystery thrillers. So I've pretty much watched every single one out there but I feel like many people haven't heard of this one. So if you're into that check it out.Let me know let me know what you think okay amazing. I have not heard of that great great choice okay. So I know you've taken a lot of courses. I forget how many i. I know that's you're a course addict so. I'm curious what's been your favorite course that you've taken. I really love susie. Batis's course called alive. Os susie is the the founder and former ceo of poo-pourri. She's now chairman of poopery. She grew her business. I think she started poo pourri in her late 30s or 40s after after multiple bankruptcies and she created this amazing course that it's hard to describe it's kind of it's kind of about mindset and overcoming internal blockers. So it's a little bit you know on the softer side. But I feel like it was just amazing community amazing exercises that you go through with your small pod. It led to some really big breakthroughs including starting maven as the company. So at the end of at the end of that eight week course.I was kind of debating you know should. I should. I do this or should. I not and with my small group. I worked through. It talked a lot about you know just subconsciously. I was feeling about it and stuff and it was really good. So a live os by suzie batis and it's still going yeah yeah.She was one of my clients when I was consulting and yeah she's amazing okay. We're gonna link to that while we're on this topic how many courses would you save taken taken and built a lot dozens dozens that have had hundreds of cohorts within you know each course so yeah um yeah. Okay lots of courses that you said addict so yeah. Okay. What's your favorite maven course right now to give a little plug to maven oh probably amanda natividad's course on content marketing. It's called content marketing 201 or I haven't taken this but I've heard really good things about marylee nica's course on breaking into technical product management. She's a technical pm with a phd at meta right. Now she was at google before her course is fantastic awesome okay final question. What's your least favorite fruit probably grapes. But when they're frozen they're kind of like little popsicles. So they're they're not too bad when they're frozen but probably grapes wow and it's a surprising answer very concerning oh okay. I love that that's my most contrarian spiky point of view is that I just like grapes might just be. It's just like a explosion of flavor and sugar okay well. We've reached the end of our chat wes if it wasn't. Obvious this was incredibly fun. I had so much so much fun chatting and learning from you.
