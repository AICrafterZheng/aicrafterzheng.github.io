# Become a better communicator
Specific frameworks to improve your clarity, influence, and impact.

In today's fast-paced business environment, effective communication is not just a nice-to-have skill—it's essential for career success. As Meta CTO Boz aptly states, "Communication is the job." In this comprehensive guide, we'll explore powerful frameworks and tactics for becoming a more effective communicator, based on insights from communication expert Wes Kao.

## Why Communication Matters

The impact of poor communication can be far more significant than most people realize. As Wes explains:

> "The blast radius of a poorly written memo is way bigger than most people think. If you're just shooting off a message in a Slack channel with 15 other people and it's confusing, there's going to be a bunch of back and forth. Whereas if you had just taken another look at it, those 15 people would be off to the races."

## Key Frameworks for Better Communication

### 1. Sales Before Logistics

One common mistake is jumping straight into the "how" before establishing the "why." Wes advocates for a two-step approach:

1. First, sell people on why something matters
2. Only then share the logistics and details

Even for seemingly quick communications, spending 30 seconds to frame the "why" can dramatically improve buy-in and understanding.

### 2. The MOO Framework (Most Obvious Objection)

Before presenting ideas or sending important communications, ask yourself: What are the most obvious objections someone might have? This simple practice helps you:

- Anticipate potential pushback
- Address concerns proactively
- Strengthen your argument before sharing

### 3. CEDAF Framework for Delegation

When delegating tasks, whether to team members or AI assistants, use the CEDAF framework:  

- Comprehension: Ensure they have everything needed to understand the task  
- Excitement: Explain why this matters and generate enthusiasm
- De-risk: Identify and address potential risks upfront
- Align: Confirm mutual understanding
- Feedback: Establish short feedback loops

## Practical Tips for Better Communication

### Being Concise

Contrary to popular belief, being concise isn't about absolute word count—it's about economy of words. Kao emphasizes:

> "Being concise is not about absolute word count, it's about density of insight. You can have a 300-word memo that's meandering and long-winded and a thousand word memo that is tight and concise."

### The Power of Preparation

Even a few minutes of preparation before meetings or important communications can dramatically improve your effectiveness. Ask yourself:

- What do I want to achieve?
- What's my main point?
- What objections might arise?

### Managing Up Effectively

The key to managing up isn't just updating your boss—it's sharing your point of view. Instead of asking "What should we do?" try presenting your recommendation with supporting evidence and asking for feedback.

## Building Your Communication Toolkit

### The Swipe File Technique

Create a collection of effective communication examples you encounter:

- Phrases that resonated
- Well-structured arguments
- Effective presentations
- Clear explanations

Even if you rarely review it, the act of collecting these examples trains you to notice effective communication patterns.

### Leveraging AI for Better Communication

AI tools like Claude can be powerful allies in improving communication. Kao shares how she uses AI:

- As a thought partner for drafting difficult messages
- To get alternative perspectives on communication approaches
- For refining and improving initial drafts

## Conclusion

Becoming a better communicator isn't about dramatic changes—it's about making small, consistent investments in how we communicate. As Wes emphasizes, spending just a few extra minutes on important communications can yield significant returns in clarity, influence, and impact.
