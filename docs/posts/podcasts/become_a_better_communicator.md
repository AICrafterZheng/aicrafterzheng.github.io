# Become a better communicator
Specific frameworks to improve your clarity, influence, and impact.


## Foundational Principles
- Communication is a skill that directly impacts outcomes and can be improved through practice
- Take responsibility for communication effectiveness rather than blaming others for misunderstandings
- Practice communication skills consistently, not just with executives

## Key Frameworks

### Sales Before Logistics Framework
- Start by selling the "why" before diving into implementation details
- Even brief context (30-60 seconds) helps align stakeholders
- Particularly important when seeking buy-in from busy executives

### MOO (Most Obvious Objection) Framework
- Anticipate potential objections before presenting
- Spend a few minutes thinking through likely pushback
- Address obvious concerns proactively in communication

### CEDAF Framework for Delegation
- Comprehension: Ensure clear understanding of requirements
- Excitement: Explain why the task matters
- De-risk: Anticipate and address potential issues
- Align: Confirm mutual understanding
- Feedback: Create short feedback loops

## Tactical Advice

### On Being Concise
- Being concise isn't about word count but about density of insight
- Preparation is key to concise communication
- Clear thinking leads to clear communication

### On Managing Up
- Share point of view proactively rather than just asking for direction
- Demonstrate strategic thinking by offering recommendations
- Managing up becomes more important, not less, as you become more senior

### On Giving Feedback
- Focus on motivating behavior change rather than emotional expression
- Remove venting elements that don't serve the goal of improvement
- Consider "strategy, not self-expression" principle

## Professional Development Tools

### Swipe File Technique
- Collect effective communication examples
- Include phrases, designs, documents that work well
- Use as reference for improving own communication

### AI Integration
- Use AI tools like Claude as thought partners
- Provide context and point of view when prompting
- Particularly useful for drafting difficult communications
