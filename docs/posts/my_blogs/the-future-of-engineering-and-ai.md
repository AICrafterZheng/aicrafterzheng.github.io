# 🚀 The Future of Engineering & AI — Insights from CEOs



## Michael Truell - CEO of Cursor

> "We're not going straight to a world where AI does everything and engineers disappear. Instead, engineers are shifting roles—from implementers to orchestrators."

### Everyone Become Engineering Managers

> "I think something people don't talk enough about when discussing AI agents and AI engineers doing all this stuff for you… is basically we're all becoming engineering managers."

### 1. **Engineering Manager Analogy**:
  - As AI agents take on more of the implementation work, human engineers increasingly focus on **specification**, **review**, and **iteration**.
  - It feels like managing a team of junior engineers that “aren’t that smart yet” — they constantly check in, and you need to inspect everything.

### 2. **Cognitive Load Shifts**:
  - Instead of writing all the code, you spend more time:
    - Specifying the task with precision
    - Reviewing AI output
    - Iterating with tighter feedback loops

### 3. **Two Emerging Workflows**:
  1. **Macro delegation**: Specify everything upfront, let AI execute, then review the whole thing.
  2. **Micro-iteration**: Specify a small task, review the AI’s output, iterate step-by-step.

> *"Most successful users today chop things up. They don’t try to offload giant tasks all at once."*

### 4. **The Vibe Coding Trap**:
  - Over-delegating to AI without sufficient understanding can lead to messy, unmaintainable code.
  - Cursor aims to empower engineers to stay in the driver’s seat while still leveraging automation.

## Varun Mohan - CEO of Windsurf (acquired by OpenAI)
Why Varun believes 90% of Code Will Be AI-Generated — But Engineering Jobs Will Grow.
### 1. **Code Becomes the Commodity — Taste & Intent Become the Skill**

- Most **boilerplate and repetitive logic** will be handled by AI.
- Engineers shift from typing syntax to **defining what needs to be built** — the higher-value, human work.
- This creates demand for **more engineers who can think clearly**, not just code.

> "AI is lowering the barrier to turn ideas into working software. That doesn’t kill engineering — it multiplies the demand."
>

### 2. **Software Demand Is Unbounded**

- As cost of production drops, **demand explodes**:
    - More startups
    - More internal tools
    - More customization
- Every team will want software tailored to their niche workflows.

> "If software gets 10x cheaper to build, you don’t fire engineers — you build 10x more software."
>

### 3. **Engineers Become Architects and Curators**

- Engineers will act like **project leads, reviewers, product thinkers**.
- They’ll manage AI-generated output, ensure quality, handle edge cases, and direct architecture decisions.
- This is analogous to how **designers** use Figma AI features — but the best still lead the process.

---

### 4. **AI Generates Code, Not Context**

- AI lacks full understanding of:
    - Business goals
    - User experience nuance
    - Product strategy
- **Human engineers** are essential for bridging code to real-world context.

> "You still need humans to know what should be built — and why."
>

### 5. **More Non-Engineers Will Create Software — But Engineers Will Enable It**

- Low-code and AI tools let PMs, ops teams, and analysts build simple tools.
- But engineers are still needed to:
    - Build frameworks
    - Ensure reliability
    - Handle edge cases
    - Maintain standards

> “AI is not replacing engineers — it’s leveling them up.”

## Scott Wu - CEO of Cognition (maker of Devin)


### 1. Why Engineering Will Shift from “Bricklayers” to “Architects”

> **“One of the ways that we've thought about Devin is really allowing engineers to go from bricklayer to architect.”**

- **Traditional Engineering is 90% Implementation**
    - Much of today’s engineering involves debugging, boilerplate, migrations, CI/CD tasks, and infrastructure work.
    - Only ~10% is truly **architectural thinking** — designing systems, understanding problems deeply, and crafting solutions.

- **Devin Automates the Bricklaying**
    - By automating mundane and repetitive engineering tasks (e.g., writing boilerplate, fixing bugs, generating tests), Devin frees up engineers.
    - Engineers can now focus on **problem-solving, high-level system design**, and decision-making.

- **Programming Becomes More Important, Not Less**
    - Even as AI takes over more coding, **knowing how to instruct the computer** (i.e., understanding abstractions, systems, architecture) becomes even more valuable.
    - Engineers evolve into system architects: defining the problem, specifying the desired solution, and orchestrating AI agents to execute it.

### 2. Skills That Will Grow in Importance:

- System design and architecture
- Abstraction thinking and decomposition
- Precise specification and prompt engineering
- Understanding full-stack flows and trade-offs
- Collaborating with AI as a multiplier

### 3. Skills That Will Diminish:

- Low-level implementation
- Routine debugging and plumbing
- Manual CI/CD tasks and migrations

### 4. Moats and stickiness in AI
>  "People talk about moats in AI — distribution, scale, model performance — but I think the real moat is user stickiness. AI that helps you with your data, your voice, your style, your tools, your business — the more personal it gets, the harder it is to switch."
