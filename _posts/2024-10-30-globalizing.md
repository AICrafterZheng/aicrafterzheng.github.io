## TL;DR
1. **Building in Public**
1. **Individual Entrepreneurship is a Future Trend**
   - AI and remote work make one-person companies more feasible.
1. **No Need to Overly Rely on Funding; Start with Lean Startup Methods**
1. **Register Platforms and Services as a Company, Not as an Individual**  
   - Using a company entity can mitigate the risk of unlimited personal liability.

### Building in Public
- Build a personal brand through social media.
- Sharing genuine stories and experiences is more effective than purely promoting products.
- Consistently create content to build an audience.

### Ways to Identify Product Needs
- Solve your own real-world problems.
- Observe successful examples.
- Discover needs through user comments on official forums and communities.
- Seek opportunities in new products and trends, such as:
  - Apple Vision Pro
  - Meta Threads

### Product Development Strategy
- Start with a small niche to avoid creating a large, all-encompassing product from the beginning.
- Choose a niche market to avoid direct competition with big companies.
- Focus on product differentiation and competitive advantages.

### Product Pricing
- Consider setting a higher price; avoid underpricing.
- Higher pricing helps users recognize the product’s value.
- Adjust prices through discounts and other offers.

### Product Launch and Marketing
- Launch on ProductHunt.
- Submit products to directory sites.
- Market on Reddit communities.
- Email marketing (especially cold emails).
- Paid advertising.
- Influencer marketing (with careful evaluation).

### Use Terms Like "Independent Creator" or "One-Person Company" Instead of "Independent Developer"
- Creating products is more than just coding.
- It involves product design, operations, marketing, and other areas.

### Avoid Over-Reliance on Funding
- The goal of an independent creator or one-person company is to achieve stable income, not explosive growth.
- Do what you want without restrictions from investors.
- Maintain full control over your product and company.
- Start with a lean approach:
  - Begin on a small scale.
  - Improve the product based on user feedback.
  - Support growth with revenue to achieve sustainable development.

### Company Registration and Compliance
- Register platforms and services as a company entity rather than as an individual.
- Using a company entity can help avoid the risk of unlimited personal liability.
- Avoid using informal registration methods to prevent account bans and personal data from being blacklisted.

### Team Collaboration
- Be cautious when choosing partners.
- Build trust through long-term collaboration.
- Consider hiring agents or outsourcing teams.

### Social Media Management
- Run both English and Chinese accounts.
- Personal accounts are more relatable to users than brand accounts.
- Share personal stories and experiences to increase engagement.
- Actively interact and build connections:
  - Respond to others' original posts.
  - Engage in proactive outreach.

### Platform Selection Suggestions
- Independent developer communities are primarily active on Twitter.
- Fashion and younger audiences prefer Instagram.
- Choose platforms based on target audience; go where your users are.
